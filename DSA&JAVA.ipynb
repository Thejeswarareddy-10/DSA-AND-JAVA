    "# Academic Exam Results Management System #\n",

    "# Introduction : #\n",
    "**Aim :** Our aim is to develop a model of academic exam results management system which which can quick access, storage and authorization of student results.<br>\n",
    "**Implementations in this project :** \n",
    "1) We are trying to develop a web page so that it can display the results of the individual students seperately.\n",
    "2) There are seperate profile's for each student and teachers so that teachers can edit the marks but students can only view their marks.\n",
    "3) We are using Binary search tree for quick insertion, deletion, searching and ranking of the results.\n",
    "4) We are using Priority queue for efficient ranking and sorting of best performing students.\n",
    "5) We are trying to load and read the data from an excel file and also it can rewrite the data in the excel file.<hr>\n",
    "# About data structure \n",
    "# 1) Binary Search Tree  <br>\n",
    "* Binary search tree is a type of data structrure in which it has atmost two children known as left and right child. In which the left subtree and its children has value lesser than the parent node and right subtree and its children has values higher than the parent node.<br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* This data structure has efficient insertion, deletion andd searching in the time-complexity of O(log n) in which n is number of nodes in that tree.<br>\n",
    "**Advantages of Binary search tree over other data structures**<br>\n",
    "* Searching in sorted array takes (O(log n)) time but insertion and deletion takes (O(n)) time. Whereas in BST it takes (O(log n)) for all the operations.\n",
    "* Searching in a linked list is O(n) (linear search), whereas BST has O(log n) search and also BST sorts the data automatically but linked lists need seperate sorting operations.\n",
    "* So overall, the operations like insertion, deletion and searching in BST takes less time and more effectively when compared to other data structures.<br>\n",
    "**What  does BST do in our project :**<br>\n",
    "* Each node in the BST represents a students record. The records are stored in sorted order based on their roll numbers.\n",
    "* Whenever a new student result is available it automatically sorts his result into the structure without additional sorting operations.\n",
    "* To search in a BST data structure it will be easier because of its properties like left child is lesser than the root node and right child is greater then the root node.\n",
    "* It will also display the results in ascending order it is also called inorder traversal property of BST.<hr>\n",
    "# 2) Priority Queue <br>\n",
    "* A Priority Queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before elements with lower priority, regardless of the order in which they were added.\n",
    "* It has different time-complexities for each operations like (O(n log n)) for insertion and sorting, (O(n)) for searching and deletion where n is number of nodes.<br>\n",
    "***Advantages of Priority queue over other data structures:***<br>\n",
    "* The Priority Queue is more efficient for accessing the highest or lowest priority element compared to an unsorted array.\n",
    "* Priority Queue is better for dynamically managing tasks with different priorities, while a Linked List is better for ordered sequences.\n",
    "* Priority Queue allows priority-based access, whereas Stacks follow LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), making stacks unsuitable for scheduling tasks where priority matters.\n",
    "* A Priority queue sorts the data based on our priorities whereas a normal queue data structure follows the principle first in first out(FIFO) in whihc it doesn't have a sorted data.\n",
    "* A priority queue has is faster time-complexity in insertion and deletion operations and also in priority queue data structure can delete elements from a particular position without shifting elements unlike sorted array.<br>\n",
    "**What does priority queue do in our project :** <br>\n",
    "* The Priority Queue in our project helps in managing students's results based on their overall percentage. It is primarily used for ranking students in descending order of their results.\n",
    "* When the student's results are added, the results are sorted in descending order based on their average percentage of all subjects and the top performing students will be displayed first.\n",
    "* When a student data is deleted their record is also removed from the queue this ensures the ranking stays updated from time to time.<br><hr>\n",
    "# Concept of OOPS in our project <br>\n",
    "1) *Encapsulation :* This method stores student data in private. The root node is not exposed directly but it can be modified.<br>\n",
    "2) *Polymorphism :* There might be some methods with performs the same function but with different logics like when we used to search a student details by using their name and by using their roll number.\n",
    "3) *Abstraction :*  It is used in our project by hiding complex implementations behind simple functions, allowing users to interact with the system without worrying about internal details.<hr>\n",
    "# Code structure and design : \n",
    "There will be 4 classes in our project:\n",
    "1) Student_node\n",
    "2) BST\n",
    "3) Priority_queue\n",
    "4) Results_management<br>\n",
    "**Methods in each class :**<br>\n",
    "**1) Student_node**\n",
    "* init: Initializes a student node in which it has student details like their name, roll number and percentages.\n",
    "2) BST\n",
    "* init: Initializes an empty BST.\n",
    "* insert: Inserts a student data into the BST.\n",
    "* search_by_roll_no: Searches for a student by roll number.\n",
    "* search_by_name: Searches for students by name.\n",
    "* delete: Deletes a student by roll number.\n",
    "* min_value_node: Finds the node with the smallest value.\n",
    "3) Priority_queue\n",
    "* init: Initializes an empty priority queue.\n",
    "* add_student: Adds a student which is sorted by percentage.\n",
    "* remove_student: Removes a student from the queue.\n",
    "* display_top_students: Displays the top students based on percentage.\n",
    "4) Results_management\n",
    "* init: Initializes the system and loads student data from an Excel file.\n",
    "* add_result(self, roll_no, name, percentages, save=True): Adds a student's exam result.\n",
    "* delete_student: Deletes a student by roll number or name.\n",
    "* display_results: Displays all student records.\n",
    "* search_student: Searches for a student by roll number or name.\n",
    "* save_to_excel: Saves student data to an Excel file.\n",
    "* load_from_excel: Loads student data from an Excel file.<hr>\n",
    "# Data Preperation\n",
    "**1) Data Collection**\n",
    "* The system takes student details from the user and is stored as subject wise marks and also the system can load existing student data from an excel file.<br>\n",
    "**2) Data processing**\n",
    "* After collecting data the system process it by inserting student details into a binary search tree and adding the student to a priority queue so that it can sort the top performing ones by arranging their final percentage into a descending order.<br>\n",
    "**3) Data storage**\n",
    "* After adding or deleting students data is saved in a excel file. It also uses *pandas* to store structred data in a tabular form in the excel sheet.<br>\n",
    "**4) Data retrieval**\n",
    "* We can search for a student by their name or roll number, we can print student results from BST or priority queue when needed."
